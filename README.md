# Skin Cancer Detection and Image Generation with CNN and GAN

This project focuses on detecting skin cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and generating synthetic skin lesion images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The code is modular and built for training, evaluating, and expanding deep learning models on dermatology image datasets.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Skin cancer image classification with CNN
- Synthetic skin lesion generation using GAN
- Custom training, evaluation, and model definition functions
- TensorFlow + Keras-based implementation
- Ready to plug in real-world datasets

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
